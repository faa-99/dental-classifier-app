The pre-trained VGG16 model was used as a base model, followed by a convolutional neural network model. The 
architecture is depicted in the figure below. Training was done using dental x-rays from the UFBA_UESC
dental images dataset which includes structural variations regarding the number of teeth,
restorations, implants, appliances, and the size of the mouth and jaws."""
